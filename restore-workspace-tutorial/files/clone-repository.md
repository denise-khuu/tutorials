Paste the URL to the 'git clone' command to clone the repostitory. For this tutorial we will use the original tutorials repository of the 'devonfw-tutorials' GitHub account.

When you run the command on your machine, you will of course need to customize the URL and add your personal GitHub name. So the command will be git clone https://github.com/YourName/workspace-devon4ng.git.
